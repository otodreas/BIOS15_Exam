# BIOS15_Exam
Final exam for BIOS15 2025, Lund University

The script and dataset are the only files needed to run the analyses. They can be found at

```{markdown}
root/
└── Report/
    ├── Scripts/
    │   └── Analysis.R
    └── Data/
        └── penstemon_copy.txt
```

Note that if you run the script on its own and define your own filepath to the data, you will also need to define a path for the output files.
