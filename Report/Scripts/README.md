# Scripts notes

## Running the script
- Make sure you have packages installed
- Note that input files are read from the `Data` folder and output files are written to the `Output` directory, so if you didn't clone the entire repo and just downloaded the file, you will need to change those filepaths
    - The data file can be found at `root/Report/Data/penstemon_copy.txt`
